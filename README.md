# Advent of Code

These are my [Advent of Code][AoC] puzzle solutions.

For this year I decided to use [Golang][go] for puzzles who involves mainly complex data structures (because I like the way Go manages pointes), and [Java][java] for math based puzzled, or the ones that involves the manage of huge quantities of data or "big" values. 

My goal is to practice as much as possible under different types of problems, looking for an optimal way to solve them. My solutions will not be the best, nor the cleanest, but they will be those developed using my knowledge.
